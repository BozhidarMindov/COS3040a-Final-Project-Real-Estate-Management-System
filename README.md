# COS3040a-Final-Project-Real-Estate-Management-System
This repository contains my personal project I created for the COS3040a Programming in Python course from AUBG.

The project is meant to represent a Real Estate Management System, where users can select, filter, and sort property data. The project contains unit tests for classes with 100% coverage.
